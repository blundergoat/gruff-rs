# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **Visible accepted-abbreviation contract.** `gruff-rs init` now explains that `allowlists.acceptedAbbreviations` controls short-name acceptance, replaces the built-in list, and should be extended by appending project vocabulary to the visible 16-entry seed.
- **Structured composite-action arguments.** The GitHub Action now accepts newline-delimited `argv`, rejects legacy `args` fail-closed, and contains working/output paths within the workspace.
- **Exact, verified composite-action install.** The action now requires an exact binary version, downloads from the fixed project release origin, verifies the matching SHA-256 sidecar and archive members, and installs only the verified binary from a private runner directory; mutable `cargo-binstall@main` and `latest` paths are removed.
- **Verified five-platform release candidates.** A non-publishing workflow now binds the source commit and Cargo package to Linux, macOS, and Windows archives, rejects incomplete or mismatched asset sets, and reuses those gates for serialized crate-first, draft-first tag publication.
- **Pinned, least-privilege release execution.** CI and release workflows now use full commit SHAs for third-party actions, exact Rust/Cargo-tool versions, checksum-verified actionlint downloads, read-only defaults, and write access only for final GitHub publication; a contract test rejects moving refs, floating installs, or permission drift.
- **Explicit composite-action security coverage.** Directly supplied `action.yml` and `action.yaml` files now receive event-interpolation, remote-shell, and full-SHA dependency checks, while workflow-only trigger and permission rules remain limited to workflows and ordinary scans retain project ignore policy. Broad-permission findings now distinguish workflow-level scoped writes and `write-all` from bounded job-scoped mappings.

## v0.4.0 - 2026-06-14

0.4.0 is a precision, correctness, and runtime-efficiency release for hook-facing scans. It keeps the report schema stable, makes partial-context analysis safer, tightens high-noise rules found by external scans, and retires two default rubrics that could not be made precise enough for agent hooks.

- **Partial-context dead-code safety.** Project-level dead-code findings are held back when a scan doesn't cover the whole Rust tree; a diagnostic points to a full scan.
- **Sharper security and secret rules.** Dynamic SQL findings now require a real SQL keyword; high-entropy checks skip inert text (integrity hashes, base64 alphabets, slugs, model IDs) but still flag real secrets.
- **Hook and Rust-pipeline efficiency.** Hook diff analysis avoids duplicate work, batched Git export cuts overhead, and rule dispatch skips disabled families sooner.
- **Non-UTF-8 text robustness.** Broad scans skip invalid (non-UTF-8) text with a diagnostic instead of failing; named and security-relevant files stay visible.
- **External-scan false-positive fixes.** Dead-code skips exported/plugin/allowed items; path-traversal needs filesystem-join evidence and honors sanitizers; lock-across-await ignores immediate extraction.
- **Removed two noisy default rules:** `modernisation.public-field` and `test-quality.no-assertions`. Public contract fields and harness-style tests need design intent the analyzer can't reliably guess.
- **Kept `security.path-traversal-candidate` on by default.** A review found no reason to weaken it; wording or metadata may still change without cutting coverage.
- **Rule catalogue 87 → 85.** The two retired IDs are gone from `list-rules`, config, docs, and output; schema versions and finding identities are unchanged.

## v0.3.0 - 2026-06-09

0.3.0 makes gruff easier to adopt and sharpens its rules: a new `hook` command that speaks the cross-analyzer `gruff.hook.v1` contract, tri-state baselines, count-based gates, a "fail-on-new" mode, eleven new security/secret rules, and four low-value rubrics dropped. JSON stays additive; new gates are opt-in.

- **New `hook` command.** `gruff-rs hook --format json` emits the cross-analyzer `gruff.hook.v1` contract — render-ready findings (`file`, `scope`, `stableIdentity`, non-null `remediation`, `metadata`) plus `suppressed.count`, `ignored.paths`, and `config`; `--capabilities` advertises support.
- **Changed-region hook fairness.** `line`/`symbol` findings stay scoped to changed ranges; `file`/`project` findings are dropped and counted in `suppressed.count` instead of leaking via synthetic anchors.
- **Native new-only hook.** `hook --baseline`/`--diff <ref>` surface only findings new vs. the base, with count-based suppression so a newly added duplicate still shows. `--diff` runs Git, so it needs the hidden `--diff-git-unsafe` opt-in (per ADR-019).
- **Additive finding enrichment.** Findings gain `scope`; threshold rules emit `metadata.measured`/`threshold`/`unit`/`direction`. File/project stable identities are value-independent; fingerprints and baselines unchanged.
- **Changed-region scoping for `analyse`.** Limit findings to changed lines via `--diff-patch`/`--changed-ranges` (no Git) or `--since`/`--diff` (Git, needs `--diff-git-unsafe`).
- **`paths.ignore` applies everywhere** — the walk, explicit file args, and diff modes — so a hook can't flag a deliberately-ignored file.
- **New `check-ignore` command.** Reports whether gruff would ignore a path and why, matching `git check-ignore` exit codes.
- **Tri-state baselines.** Findings are labelled `new`/`unchanged`/`resolved`; the default list is unchanged.
- **Count-based gates + `--fail-on-new`.** A `gate:` block caps findings by count (e.g. "10 warnings, no errors"); `--fail-on-new` gates only on findings new since the baseline.
- **Nine new security rules** — five GitHub Actions checks plus SSRF, unsafe-deserialization, XXE, and template/XSS; `severity:` overrides now apply to security/dependency rules.
- **Two new secret checks** — `phi-pattern` (health IDs) and `gcp-service-account-key`, with wider token coverage. Output stays redacted.
- **Removed four low-value rubrics:** `complexity.npath`, `metrics.halstead-volume`, `metrics.maintainability-pressure`, and `design.god-function`.
- **Sharper, quieter rules** — dead-code now flags unused private `const`s/`static`s/type aliases (skipping cfg/test/trait-impl); complexity ignores comments and `?`; `parameter-count` 5 → 7.
- **Rule catalogue 80 → 87** (four removed, eleven added); `waste.unnecessary-clone-candidate` ships disabled. Schemas, rule IDs, and fingerprints unchanged.
- **JSON `file` alias.** `analyse --format json` emits canonical `findings[].file` (and `score.topOffenders[].file`) alongside the deprecated `filePath`.

## v0.2.0 - 2026-05-28

The first `0.2.x` release: cross-port ergonomics plus schema and CLI-default changes held for a major bump. See `UPGRADING.md` to migrate from 0.1.x.

- **Breaking: `analyse --fail-on` now defaults to `advisory`** (was `error`) - restore with `--fail-on error` or `minimumSeverity.analyse: error`.
- **Breaking: `.gruff-rs.yaml` requires `schemaVersion: gruff-rs.config.v1`** - configs without it are rejected; `init --force` adds it.
- **Breaking: JSON schemas bumped to v2** (`gruff.analysis.v2`, `gruff.summary.v2`) with additive fields; v1 carries forward, baseline and SARIF unchanged.
- **Per-rule scoring opt-out** - `excludeFromScore: true` keeps a rule's findings visible but drops its score penalty.
- **Per-rule deltas in baseline/diff scans** - reports show top improved/regressed rules; JSON adds `perRuleDeltas[]`.
- **`list-rules <rule_id>` detail card** - defaults, options, escape hatches, false-positive shapes, and related rules.
- **`stableIdentity` on every finding** - a line-insensitive hash so external diff tools match findings across edits; `fingerprint` stays line-sensitive.
- **Per-subcommand `--fail-on` defaults** via a `minimumSeverity:` block for `analyse` and `report`.
- **Richer summary JSON** - `pillars[]` carries nine fields for every pillar; `topRules[]` gains severity, confidence, and a description.
- **Markdown and HTML reports gain a pillars table** - seven columns; HTML drops its card grid for it.
- **Triage hint** - text scans past 50 findings point at `summary --top 20`.
- **Escape-hatch hints in eleven remediations** - each names the relevant `.gruff-rs.yaml` knob.
- **`docs.missing-*` reworded for agents** - ask for a brief intent line, not a stub doc comment.
- **Default `accepted_abbreviations` grows 6 → 16.** Upgrade note: the loader replaces (not merges) the list, so run `init --force` to pick up the new ones.
- **Twelve rules ship false-positive metadata** (`false_positive_shapes`, `related_rules`).
- **Determinism and correctness fixes** - stable diagnostic ordering, finding-sourced summary severity, and de-duplicated baseline deltas.
- **Internal refactors** - shared single sources for pillar labels/digests; v2 shape aligns with the `gruff-go`/`-ts`/`-py`/`-php` ports.

## v0.1.1 - 2026-05-24

Ten new default-on rules, the `gruff-rs init` scaffold, broader `paths.ignore` defaults, and split-out docs.

- **Ten new default-on rules** (67 → 77) - four `modernisation.*` lints, four `docs.missing-*` rules, `security.path-traversal-candidate`, and `test-quality.should-panic-without-expected`.
- **`gruff-rs init` scaffold** - writes a default `.gruff-rs.yaml`, preserving custom `paths.ignore`.
- **`security.path-traversal-candidate` precision guards** - six guards (typed-path args, validate-then-trust, sanitizer calls, …) cut false positives.
- **`modernisation.manual-contains` tightened** - matches only deref/RHS-ref shapes; bare `|x| x == y` is skipped.
- **`docs.missing-param-doc`/`-return-doc` skip bridge functions** - `#[tauri::command]`, `#[wasm_bindgen]`, `#[pyfunction]`, etc.
- **Broader `paths.ignore` defaults** - skips agent/CLI dirs (`.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.goat-flow/`, …) and lockfiles.
- **CLI and dependency tooling** - a `--baseline` path option and `dependency-{install,update}.sh` that auto-install `cargo-audit`.
- **Documentation pages** - separate guides for CI, config, the dashboard, output formats, and releases.
- **Calibration matrix 77/77 and internal refactors** - every rule has positive/negative cases (dogfood 100/A); rule files split for size, helpers renamed to predicate form.

## v0.1.0 - 2026-05-23

First public release. Deterministic, schema-versioned quality analyzer for Rust projects; single-binary CLI you can drop into CI.

- **Commands** - `analyse`, `report`, `summary`, `list-rules`, `dashboard`, `completion`.
- **Output formats** - text, JSON (`gruff.analysis.v1`), SARIF 2.1.0, HTML, Markdown, GitHub annotations, hotspot.
- **Default-on rules across eleven pillars** - complexity, dead-code, design, documentation, maintainability, modernisation, naming, security, sensitive-data, size, test-quality.
- **`.gruff-rs.yaml` config** - selectors, thresholds, allowlists, custom regex rules, and report-level exclusions.
- **Baselines and patch-diff filtering** - for incremental adoption against an existing codebase.
