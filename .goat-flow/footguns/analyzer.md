## Footgun: Fixture Findings Are Intentional

**Status:** active | **Created:** 2026-05-13 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

`fixtures/sample.rs` (search: `AKIA1111111111111111`) intentionally includes secret-looking strings, command execution, a long parameter list, and a weak test. Do not "fix" this file as ordinary bad code unless the replacement still proves the analyzer reports those rule families.

The non-obvious failure mode is losing analyzer coverage while making the repository appear cleaner. The smoke command `cargo run -- analyse fixtures --format json --fail-on none` currently reports findings from this fixture.

## Footgun: Code-Shape Rules Can Scan Fixture Strings

**Status:** active | **Created:** 2026-05-13 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

`src/main.rs` (search: `fn strip_rust_string_literals`) masks Rust string literals before code-shape checks such as complexity, unwrap, process command, unsafe, and test-quality scans. Secret scanners intentionally still inspect raw text.

Without that split, self-scan can report rule examples embedded inside unit-test fixture strings as if they were real analyzer code. M03 caught this when test-quality checks flagged raw fixture snippets in `src/main.rs` tests.

## Footgun: Dashboard Scans Change Process Cwd

**Status:** resolved | **Created:** 2026-05-13 | **Resolved:** 2026-05-13 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

Before M04, dashboard `/scan` changed the process working directory before calling `run_analysis`, then restored the previous directory afterward.

M04 replaced that with `src/main.rs` (search: `fn run_analysis_in_project`) and `src/main.rs` (search: `fn dashboard_response`), so dashboard scans pass an explicit project root and do not mutate cwd. Regression coverage lives in `src/main.rs` (search: `dashboard_scan_preserves_cwd_and_report_paths`).

## Footgun: Rust Parsing Was Regex And Brace Counting

**Status:** resolved | **Created:** 2026-05-13 | **Resolved:** 2026-05-13 | **Evidence:** ACTUAL_MEASURED

Before M01, `src/main.rs` (search: `fn rust_function_blocks`) extracted functions with a regex and brace-depth scan, and `parse_diagnostics` only checked delimiter balance.

M01 replaced that path with `src/main.rs` (search: `fn parse_source_file`) using `syn::parse_file` and `src/main.rs` (search: `fn rust_function_blocks`) walking the parsed AST. The regression proof is `cargo run --quiet -- analyse src --format json --fail-on none` exiting 0 with zero diagnostics and `cargo test` passing parser fixtures for raw strings, macros, impl methods, test attributes, and invalid Rust.
