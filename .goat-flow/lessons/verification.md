## Lesson: Shell Wrapper Path Resolution Must Pass Shellcheck

**Created:** 2026-05-16

When adding POSIX shell entrypoint wrappers, do not copy the `CDPATH= cd ...`
idiom without checking it. Shellcheck reports SC1007 because the assignment-like
prefix is easy to misread.

Use a command-substitution form that clears `CDPATH` inside the subshell:
`SCRIPT_DIR="$(unset CDPATH; cd -- "$(dirname -- "$PRG")" && pwd)"`.

When fixing findings reported by gruff itself, run a focused analyzer scan before
declaring victory. A performance fix can move code enough to create a different
finding, such as a function-length error from adding local setup inside the
target function.

If a fix introduces setup data, prefer module-level constants or small helpers
over adding bulky local tables to an already near-threshold function.
